# Proposal
My plan for the web is to construct a web introducing myself. There will be a big title of my name at the top of the page with a small photo next to it.
And there will be a guide line at the left part under the title. In the guide line there will be three part, about me, photos, my life.
Each one can be click to reach another page to show the detailed information. And I want to put some daily photos or traveling photos to my photo part.
And for my life part, I  want to include my experience during schools like the clubs, the researches, the works.

## Introduction
This web project is to build a personal website that introduces myself in a clean, interactive, and visually engaging format. At the top of the page, there will be a large title with my name "Yang Ye", alongside a small profile photo to highlight my identity.
On the top side of the page, there will be a vertical navigation bar that guides visitors to different sections: About Me, Photos, and My Life. Each section will be clickable and dynamically load different content on the same page.
- The About Me section will introduce who I am, my background, and my personality.
- The Photos section will showcase some of my daily moments, travel memories, and fun snapshots with friends.
- The My Life section will include details of my school experience: such as clubs I joined, research I participated in, and other memorable activities.

In the My School part under “My Life,” I will show my academic journey from high school to college, including names of my schools and visual elements that help tell my story.

The layout is designed to be clear and simple, while still expressing my creativity and personality. This website serves as a self-introduction and a creative portfolio of my student life.
