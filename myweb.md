# Proposal
My plan for the web is to construct a web introducing myself. There will be a big title of my name at the top of the page with a small photo next to it.
And there will be a guide line at the left part under the title. In the guide line there will be three part, about me, photos, my life.
Each one can be click to reach another page to show the detailed information. And I want to put some daily photos or traveling photos to my photo part.
And for my life part, I  want to include my experience during schools like the clubs, the researches, the works.

## Introduction
This web project is to build a personal website that introduces myself in a clean, interactive, and visually engaging format. At the top of the page, there will be a large title with my name "Yang Ye", alongside a small profile photo to highlight my identity.
On the top side of the page, there will be a vertical navigation bar that guides visitors to different sections: About Me, Photos, and My Life. Each section will be clickable and dynamically load different content on the same page.
- The intro part is a breif summary of the later different parts.
- The About Me section will introduce who I am, my background, and my personality.
- The experience part is about my previous working experience and research experience as well as other aspect of me.
- The my school part is an introduction of the school from my high school to university, where you can also reach the official website of them and get more detailed information of them.
- The Photos section will showcase some of my daily moments, travel memories, and fun snapshots with friends.

In the My School part, I will show my academic journey from high school to college, including names of my schools and visual elements that help tell my story. In this section, you can find different school with dofferent cards where you can click and get in to the detailed information of the school you click to know more about it.

The layout is designed to be clear and simple, while still expressing my creativity and personality. This website serves as a self-introduction and a creative portfolio of my student life.
