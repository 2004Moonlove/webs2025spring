  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Yang Ye</strong>,
     and I'm currently a junior student majoring in Computer Science at the <a href="./pitt.html"> <strong>University of Pittsburgh</strong></a>.
     I'm a passionate learner, always excited to explore new knowledge and challenges.</p>

  <p>I'm an <strong>outgoing</strong> and <strong>active</strong> person. Back in school, I served as a <strong>class leader</strong>,
     participated in the <strong>debate team</strong> where I trained my critical thinking and public speaking, and also joined the <strong>dance team</strong>, 
     performing at various school events.</p>

  <p>In addition, I was a member of the <strong>badminton team</strong>,
     and I enjoy playing all kinds of sports including running, basketball, and more.
     Sports have always been a big part of my life—they keep me energetic and inspired.</p>

  <p>Outside of academics and sports, I'm deeply interested in <strong>technology and creativity</strong>.
     I love building things, learning how things work, and finding ways to express myself through digital tools.</p>

  <p>This website is a small space where I share parts of my story—thank you for stopping by!</p>
