# Proposal
My plan for the web is to construct a web introducing myself. There will be a big title of my name at the top of the page with a small photo next to it.
And there will be a guide line at the left part under the title. In the guide line there will be three part, about me, photos, my life.
Each one can be click to reach another page to show the detailed information. And I want to put some daily photos or traveling photos to my photo part.
And for my life part, I  want to include my experience during schools like the clubs, the researches, the works.
